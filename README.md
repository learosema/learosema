# Hello world ðŸ‘‹

I'm a digital artist and frontend developer based in Hamburg, Germany.

Aside from my creative coding works on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/terabaud), I also have a couple of notable projects on GitHub.

- [lea-codes](https://github.com/terabaud/lea-codes) is my [personal website](https://lea.codes) built documenting my WebGL and THREE.js code journey.
- [GLea](https://github.com/terabaud/glea) (GL experience artistry) is a WebGL library I built.
- [ella-math](https://github.com/terabaud/ella-math) is a geometry and linear algebra library that provides basic vector and matrix calculus operations.
- [webgl-templates](https://github.com/terabaud/webgl-templates) - boilerplates for creating a full screen fragment shader using different frameworks
- [talentbook](https://github.com/terabaud/talentbook) - a skill sharing and networking platform
- [yesno-clone](https://github.com/terabaud/yesno-clone) - clone of yesno.wtf
- [pixelfedit](https://github.com/terabaud/pixelfedit)
