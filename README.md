# Hello world ðŸ‘‹

I'm a digital artist and frontend developer based in Hamburg, Germany. I moved to Hamburg in November 2018, when I started working at [SinnerSchrader](https://github.com/sinnerschrader), which is a digital agency. 

Before my time at SinnerSchrader, I was working as a full stack web developer at [BrÃ¼gmann Software GmbH](https://patorg.de) since 2011, which is a mid-size company in Papenburg specialized in IP management software.

Aside from my creative coding works on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/terabaud), I also have a couple of notable projects on GitHub.

## lea-codes

[lea.codes](https://lea.codes) is my personal website built with [eleventy](https://11ty.dev) documenting my WebGL and THREE.js code journey.

## glea

GLea (GL experience artistry) is a WebGL library I built.

## ella-math

ella-math is a geometry and linear algebra library that provides basic vector and matrix calculus operations.

## webgl-templates

This is a collection of WebGL templates using different frameworks (GLea, P5, Phenomenon, PIXIjs, regl and THREE). All examples span up a rectangle filling the whole window and apply a vertex and fragment shader (which is one basic example getting started with WebGL).

## talentbook

talentbook is a clone of the SkillWill application written in full stack TypeScript (TypeScript+TypeORM+Express+Swagger OpenAPI in the backend and TypeScript+React+Storybook in the frontend).

## yesno-clone

yesno-clone is a clone of the YesNo API, consuming the Giphy API. It uses TypeScript+Parcel+React in the frontend and JavaScript+Express in the backend.

It demonstrates a way how to proxy an API to your development server when using the Parcel bundler:Â Â
