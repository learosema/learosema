# Hello world ðŸ‘‹

I'm a digital artist and frontend developer based in Hamburg, Germany.

Aside from my creative coding works on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/terabaud), I also have a couple of notable projects on GitHub.

You can find me on <a rel="me" href="https://queer.party/@learosema">Mastodon</a>
